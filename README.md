# Car Loan Calculator üèéÔ∏è
A simple Python program to calculate your estimated monthly car payment based on car price, loan term, down payment, and credit score. The program allows users to input their car details and calculate their monthly car loan payment.
# How it works
The program starts by asking for the car price, ensuring it is a positive number.
Next, it asks for a valid loan term (one of 24, 36, 48, 60, or 72 months).
After that, the user enters the down payment amount, which must be non-negative and not larger than the car price.
The program asks for the user‚Äôs credit score and calculates the appropriate interest rate based on ranges (e.g., 5.25% for scores above 781).
Finally, the program calculates the monthly payment using the car price, down payment, loan term, and interest rate, and displays the result.
